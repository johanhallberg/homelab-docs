# üöÄ Getting Started with Homelab

Welcome to the ultimate homelab guide for setting up your personal cloud infrastructure using Kubernetes and other modern technologies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following:

- **Hardware Setup**: Servers with recommended specifications (see [Hardware Overview](../hardware/overview.md))
- **Network Configuration**: Proper VLAN configuration and router setup
- **Internet Access**: Stable internet connection to pull images and updates
- **Git Repositories**: Access to both k8s-cluster-config and homelab-docs repositories

### Initial Setup

1. **Server Configuration**: Ensure your servers meet the minimum hardware requirements.
2. **Network Configuration**: Set up VLANs and IP addressing.
3. **Base OS Installation**: Install Linux (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) on all nodes correctly.
4. **Kubernetes Cluster**: Follow the [Cluster Setup Guide](../kubernetes/cluster-setup.md)

### ü§ñ Deployment Automation

The homelab includes a comprehensive automation system that handles:

#### Automated Documentation Management
- **Service Catalog Updates**: Automatically detects new services and updates documentation
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Keeps service information current across deployments
- **Git Integration**: Commits and pushes documentation changes automatically

#### Discord Integration
- **Deployment Notifications**: Real-time alerts to #homelab-general channel
- **Status Updates**: Service deployment, update, and removal notifications
- **Rich Messaging**: Detailed information about changes with links to documentation

#### Uptime Monitoring
- **Automatic Monitor Creation**: Sets up Uptime Kuma monitors for external services
- **Health Checks**: Configures appropriate monitoring intervals and thresholds
- **Alert Integration**: Connects monitoring alerts to notification systems

#### Setup Instructions

**Quick Setup**:
```bash
# Navigate to homelab-docs repository
cd /path/to/homelab-docs

# Run the automated setup script
bash scripts/setup-automation.sh
```

**Manual Configuration**:
```bash
# Set environment variables
export DISCORD_HOMELAB_WEBHOOK="your_discord_webhook_url"
export UPTIME_KUMA_USERNAME="your_username"
export UPTIME_KUMA_PASSWORD="your_password"

# Install dependencies
pip3 install --user pyyaml requests

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/deployment-automation.py
chmod +x scripts/git-post-commit-hook.sh

# Install Git hook for automatic triggers
cp scripts/git-post-commit-hook.sh ../k8s-cluster-config/.git/hooks/post-commit
chmod +x ../k8s-cluster-config/.git/hooks/post-commit
```

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Add a new service manually
python3 scripts/deployment-automation.py \
  --action add \
  --name "MyApp" \
  --url "https://myapp.staging.hallonen.se" \
  --description "My awesome application"

# Scan for new services automatically
python3 scripts/deployment-automation.py --action scan

# Update an existing service
python3 scripts/deployment-automation.py \
  --action update \
  --name "MyApp" \
  --description "Updated application with new features"
```

For detailed automation documentation, see [Deployment Automation Guide](../setup/deployment-automation.md).

### GitOps Workflow

The homelab utilizes GitOps for infrastructure management:

- **FluxCD**: Automated deployment from Git repositories
- **Multi-Environment**: Separate staging and production configurations
- **Dependency Management**: Renovate for automated updates
- **Security Scanning**: Integrated vulnerability assessment

## üí° Next Steps

Proceed to set up Kubernetes using the cluster setup guide and enhance your infrastructure by integrating additional applications as needed.

# üöÄ Getting Started with the Homelab
