# üîÑ Update Operations

This document provides a detailed strategy for managing updates in your Kubernetes homelab, ensuring systems and applications remain current and secure.

## üéØ Update Philosophy

Updating is essential for:
- **Security**: Protecting against vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Enhancing system efficiency
- **Stability**: Fixing bugs and improving reliability
- **Innovation**: Accessing the latest features

## üîÑ Comprehensive Update Strategy

### Regular System Updates (Automated)

#### 1. Operating System Updates

**Approach**:
- Use unattended upgrades for daily security patches.
- Schedule major updates during weekly maintenance.

**Configuration Example**:
```bash
# Enable automatic security updates
sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades
```

#### 2. Container Image Updates

**Approach**:
- Regularly review container images for new versions.
- Avoid using `:latest` tag to prevent unexpected changes.
- Automate pulls and restarts with Kustomize or Helm.

**Best Practices**:
- Use digests or specific tags for version control.
- Regularly validate image sources for security standards.

### Kubernetes Updates (Controlled)

#### 1. Cluster Components

**When to Update**:
- Major version release: Evaluate changes and deprecations
- Patch release: Apply regularly for security fixes

**Process**:
- Review release notes and compatibility
- Test updates in staging environment
- Follow documented upgrade guides

#### 2. Helm Charts and Custom Resources

**When to Update**:
- **Charts**: Monthly, or as new versions are released
- **CRDs**: With major API changes

**Process**:
- Upgrade charts using `helm upgrade --install`
- Validate custom resources post-upgrade

### Application Updates (Flexible)

#### 1. GitOps Driven

**Approach**:
- Ensure application manifests and configurations are version controlled
- Automate updates via Flux or ArgoCD

**Best Practices**:
- Use tags and branches for controlled releases
- Implement PR-based deployment triggers

## ‚úÖ Testing Updates

**Why**: Minimize risks by validating updates in a non-production environment.

**Steps**:
1. Deploy updates to a staging environment first
2. Conduct smoke and regression tests
3. Monitor staging for unforeseen issues
4. Promote successful deployments to production

## üîÑ Rollback Strategy

**Importance**: Ensure continuity by swiftly addressing failed updates.

**Steps**:
1. Document rollback commands and dependencies
2. Test rollbacks in a controlled setting
3. Maintain backup copies of resources and data
4. Use tools like `kubectl rollout undo` for deployment rollbacks

## ‚è±Ô∏è Scheduling Updates

**Factors to Consider**:
- **Impact**: Plan updates during off-peak times
- **Frequency**: Establish a regular cadence for reviews and applications

**Sample Scheduling**:
- **Daily**: Security patches
- **Weekly**: Container image reviews
- **Monthly**: Full system audits and application updates

## üìÖ Monitoring and Documentation

Keep track of all updates for historical review and future reference:
- Document the update roadmap and history
- Use dashboards to track version statuses and update progress

**Monitoring Tools**:
- **Prometheus/Grafana** for version compliance
- **Kube-state-metrics** for resource visibility

By employing a structured update and review process, your homelab is assured of staying current, secure, and high-performing without encountering unnecessary downtime or instability.
